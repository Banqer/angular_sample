# Angular code example for interviews

This is some obsolete code we once had in Banqer High.

We've extracted it as a sample to discuss in interviews, because:

1. It's reasonably self-contained, and shouldn't require much domain knowledge about Banqer in general
2. It has a bunch of things that could be improved, so there's stuff to discuss!
